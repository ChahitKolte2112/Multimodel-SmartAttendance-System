# Multi-Model IoT-Based Smart Attendance System
### Details Project Report :
## Introduction
In this modern age, there still exists a problem with recording and maintaining faithful attendance either for students or employees. The traditional methods are time-consuming and have flaws. Thus, a modern technology-based attendance system is required. The need is further justified by studies that tell the total error rate of biometric systems is around 1%.
